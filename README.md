Grading
-------

You will be graded automatically, using the command

```
./outside-test.sh YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
```

If this command does not produce sensible output, you get 0 marks.
So, make sure it works.

(You may get some errors about 'unseen' tests, unless you change tests/inside-test.sh.
These errors don't count.)
